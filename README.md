Project: Recipes
This project is about seting up a cooking recipe webpage for learning purposes.

In this first instance i expect to use all learned basic HTML functions and make an awful looking website thats fun through the use of humor to cover my lack of technical skill. A silly plan to an even sillyer website. 
Sooooooo, that sums it up.
